# Virtual-Mouse
make virtual mouse using python and diffrent packages.
we used three packages 
1->cv2 = we used cv2 to open the camera.
2->mediapipe = we used mediapipe to point landmark on hands and draw circle on index finger.
3->pyautogui = we used ppyautogui to move the cursor and for click purpose.


#learning
